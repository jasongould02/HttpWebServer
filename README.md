# HttpWebServer

## Goal
The goal of the this project was to help me learn about HTTP and networking.

## Next
Features I wish to add:
- Server GUI
- Handling more HTTP Request Methods
    - Better response generator
- SSL or something else? 
- Change to a thread pool

## Completed
- Logging
- Server Properties 


**Note:** When using trying to access your server from a different computer,
make sure that your firewall will allow such connection on whatever port your are using.
