# HttpWebServer


<bold>Note: </bold> When using trying to access your server from a different computer,
make sure that your firewall will allow such connection on whatever port your are using.


## Goal
The goal of the this project was to help me learn about HTTP and networking.

## Next
I am working on adding functionality to have a server managing GUI as well
the ability to respond to more of the HTTP Request Methods.

I plan on implementing more features in the future.
