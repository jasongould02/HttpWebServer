# HttpWebServer

Pretty cool HTTP server. Currently with only basic capabilities.

## Goal
The goal of the this project was to help me learn about HTTP and networking.

## Next
Features I wish to add:
- Logging
- Server GUI
- Handling more HTTP Request Methods
- SSL or something else? 



**Note:** When using trying to access your server from a different computer,
make sure that your firewall will allow such connection on whatever port your are using.
